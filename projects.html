      <h2>Projects overview</h2>
      <section class="overview">
        <p>These projects utilize HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized in the first 3 projects on the
          list. 
        </p>
         <p> 
          HTML and CSS are used for basic functionality of the site, as well as
          the general style and themes of the sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is relied upon in the first project, especially. It aims to
          display a firm understanding of JavaScript, using features such as
          arrays, modifying the Document Object Model in real-time, as well as
          enhanced functionality of buttons and links on the pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are utilized in the final project on
          the list, which was a quick study of Python and an inspection of Data
          Analysis in a self-led format.

        <p>
          <strong> Pokemon Type Quiz: </strong> My latest project, utilizing
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality. It is an in-browser quiz app,
          in which once you begin the quiz, you are prompted with 8 questions
          about Pokemon type matchups; with each selection, user is prompted
          with a dialogue box showing whether they were correct, or incorrect.
          Upon quiz completion, user is shown a score of how many were correct
          out of 8, and prompted to re-take the quiz.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Pokeroute Project: </strong> This project is still a work
          in progress, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I aim to, once
          complete, have an easily navigateable site which each page will
          display a map of each Pokemon region respectively, upon which you can
          hover on certain regions of the map and it will show the available
          items/Pokemon for such areas. I aim to implement a "to-do" list of
          sorts, where you can make a goal of certain items or Pokemon you aim
          to receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Personal Site: </strong> This is the site you're on right
          now! Utilizes HTML and CSS, at the moment with updates to come. Aim to
          show technological literacy, along with highlighting marketable skills
          and previous work experience in a resume like format, accessible
          through a personal site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Heavy Burdens: </strong> This was my first, and as of right
          now only, Data Analysis project. It is an interest of mine because I
          have always personally hypothesized that low-income living, and
          obesity, go hand in hand. Upon examining the stats on these certain
          factors, my hypothesis ended up being correct. I used tools such as
          Matplotlib and Seaborn to turn the information to a graph, and
          utilized google sheets and Python to clean the data, removing
          information that wasn't needed, as well as implementing it into code
          to present the information in an easily readable and understandable
          format.
